V) Add styling options for each part of the variable's path definition.

Properties:

**_Warning:_**

The extension rely on the log message prefix in order to detect the generated log messages, missing up the prefix will result on the failure of the detection and hence the failure of commenting, uncommenting and deleting the log messages.
