## Run CI locally

You can reproduce the CI steps locally with these commands (Node.js 20 recommended):

```bash
# install deps
npm ci

# lint and unit tests
npm run lint
npm run test:jest

# compile tests for integration runner
npm run test:compile

# run integration tests (adjust platform/version as needed)
export VSCODE_TEST_PLATFORM=linux-x64    # or darwin-x64 / darwin-arm64
export VSCODE_TEST_VERSION=stable
node ./out/mocha-tests/runTests.js
```

Notes:
- Integration tests require VS Code test runner and platform-specific resources; macOS runners may be required for macOS-specific features.
- Use `VSCODE_TEST_PLATFORM`/`VSCODE_TEST_VERSION` to match your local environment or CI.
