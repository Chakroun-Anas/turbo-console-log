## Automated Logging for JavaScript/TypeScript and PHP

**Turbo Console Log transforms debugging in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and PHP.** It's built for developers who refuse to waste time manually typing log statements or hunting them down across dozens of files.

---

### **Two Editions**

**Turbo Console Log Community 🚀**  
Single-file debugging for JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP. Insert, comment, uncomment, and delete logs with keyboard shortcuts. Uses AST parsing to place logs correctly, even in complex code structures.

**Turbo Console Log Pro 👑**  
Workspace-wide log management across JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP. View all logs across your entire codebase in a tree view, delete logs by type across multiple files, filter and search logs instantly — beyond what single-file editing allows.

### 🐍 Python Support Coming June 2026

**Turbo Console Log is expanding to Python!** After successfully bringing intelligent logging to JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP, Python support launches next month with the same AST-powered precision you know and trust.

</p>

**For larger codebases with logs spread across many files, Pro provides workspace-wide visibility and management.** See all logs across your entire workspace, delete logs by type across multiple files, and use advanced filtering and search.

**Best for:** Multi-file projects, teams, large codebases, and pre-commit cleanup workflows

### 🌲 Workspace Log Explorer

**Get a complete view of all logs in your project.** The workspace explorer displays every log across all files in a native VS Code tree view.

- Navigate your entire workspace's logs from one panel
- Click any log to jump directly to its location in the code
- Handles large codebases efficiently (hundreds or thousands of files)

### 🧹 Mass Cleanup Operations

**Delete logs across multiple files at once.** Select which log types to remove and the scope (workspace, folder, or file).

- Choose specific types: `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, or all types
- Set scope: entire workspace, specific folder, or single file
- Process hundreds of logs quickly and reliably

### 🎯 Real-Time Filtering

**Filter logs by type to focus on what matters.** Toggle log types and the tree view updates instantly.

- Filter by: log, error, warn, info, debug, table
- Updates immediately without re-scanning
- Color-coded for quick visual identification (🟦 log, 🟥 error, 🟨 warn, 🟩 info, 🟪 debug, 📊 table)

### 🔍 Instant Search

**Find any log by content in seconds.** Type the keyword, see matching logs instantly, click to jump to the exact line.

- No grep, no scrolling through files, no memory required
- Search across your entire workspace
- Results update as you type

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support

Pro recognizes **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and PHP** logs in one unified view:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** All console methods and a custom log method from the settings
- **Python:** `print()`, `logging.debug()`, `logging.info()`, `logging.warning()`, `logging.error()`, and a custom log method from the settings
- **PHP:** `var_dump()`, `print_r()`, `error_log()`, and a custom log method from the settings
- **Custom Functions:** Your own logging functions, any language

### ✨ Enhanced Experience

- **Context Actions:** Right-click any log for quick actions (comment, delete, correct)
- **Auto-Correction:** Automatically updates file names and line numbers after refactoring
- **Hide Logs:** Temporarily hide logs by pattern, file, or folder
- **Smart Detection:** Recognizes both Turbo-generated logs and manually written console statements
