Internal fixes and upgrades

## [3.18.0] - 2026-03-10

### 🧠 Smarter Log Placement — The Engine Gets Sharper

**We hunted down edge cases so you don't have to.**

This release is all about correctness and collaboration. We've fixed five real-world patterns that exposed subtle AST engine bugs — and we've built a dedicated page for you to report any pattern that Turbo still gets wrong.

#### 🎯 New

- **Edge Cases Reporting Page**

  Found a code pattern that Turbo handles incorrectly? We've launched a dedicated [Edge Cases Reporting page](https://www.turboconsolelog.io/edge-cases) where you can submit snippets, describe what happened, and tell us what you expected. Every submission becomes a test case that drives a fix. Help us make Turbo smarter for everyone.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Array Destructuring + Ternary: Correct Classification & Insertion Line**

  When a variable was declared via array (or object) destructuring from a ternary expression — e.g. `const [cookieName, cookieValue]: string[] = eqIndex === -1 ? [...] : [...]` — Turbo was misclassifying the log type and inserting the log one line too early. Both the ternary checker and the insertion line calculator only handled plain `Identifier` left-hand sides, missing `ArrayPattern` and `ObjectPattern` entirely.

  **Fix**: Both helpers now correctly recognize destructuring patterns, identify the ternary initializer, and insert the log after the full ternary block.

- **TypeScript Constructor Parameters with Access Modifiers Not Recognized**

  When selecting a parameter declared with a TypeScript access modifier inside a constructor — e.g. `private backend: HttpBackend` in a multi-line Angular-style constructor with a non-empty body — Turbo failed to classify it as a `FunctionParameter`. As a result, the log was inserted at the wrong line instead of inside the constructor body. The parameter checker only handled plain `Identifier`, `ObjectPattern`, `ArrayPattern`, and `RestElement` nodes, but TypeScript access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`, `readonly`) wrap the parameter in a `TSParameterProperty` node that was never unwrapped.

  **Fix**: The checker now handles `TSParameterProperty` by unwrapping it and inspecting the inner parameter, correctly classifying access-modified constructor parameters and inserting the log at the right position.

- **WanderingExpression Identifier Nested Deep Inside Multi-Line Statement Inserts at Wrong Line**

  When selecting an identifier that appears deep inside a multi-line statement — e.g. `HTTP_INTERCEPTOR_FNS` nested inside `const dedupedInterceptorFns = Array.from(new Set([...this.injector.get(HTTP_INTERCEPTOR_FNS), ...]))` — Turbo was inserting the log inside the expression (between array elements) rather than adjacent to the containing statement. The line calculator climbed the AST parent chain only while `parent.start === node.start`, so it stopped at the `Identifier` level when the immediate parent had a different start offset, yielding a position mid-expression.

  **Fix**: The parent climb now continues until it reaches an enclosing statement boundary (`VariableDeclaration`, `ExpressionStatement`, etc.). For multi-line statements the log is inserted **before** the statement; for single-line statements it is inserted **after** — matching the behaviour of all other log types.

- **PropertyMethodCall Misclassification for Identifier Inside a Return Statement**

  When selecting an identifier used as the object of a method call inside a `return` statement body — e.g. `rawMessagePart` in `return rawMessagePart.charAt(0) === BLOCK_MARKER ? ... : ...` — Turbo was classifying the log type as `PropertyMethodCall` (priority 11) instead of `WithinReturnStatement` (priority 15). Because `PropertyMethodCall` has higher priority in the type-order table, `WithinReturnStatement` never got a chance to match, and the log was inserted at the wrong line.

  **Fix**: `propertyMethodCallChecker` now builds an ancestor map and rejects matches where the `CallExpression` is nested inside a `ReturnStatement`, letting `WithinReturnStatement` correctly claim those cases.

- **Class Property Initializer with `new` Expression Not Classified as FunctionCallAssignment**

  When selecting a class field initialized with a `new` expression — e.g. `config` in `protected config: InMemoryBackendConfigArgs = new InMemoryBackendConfig()` — Turbo failed to classify it as a `FunctionCallAssignment`. The checker only walked `VariableDeclaration` nodes and only recognized `CallExpression` as a function call, so both `PropertyDefinition` (class field) nodes and `NewExpression` (`new Foo()`) initializers were silently skipped, causing incorrect log placement.

  **Fix**: The `containsFunctionCall` helper now recognizes `NewExpression` alongside `CallExpression`. A new `PropertyDefinition` branch (backed by the `isPropertyDefinition` type guard in `acorn-utils`) was added to the walker so class field initializers are correctly inspected and classified.

## [3.17.0] - 2026-02-25

### 🧠 Context-Aware Notification Timing

**Better timing, not more notifications.**

This release introduces intelligent scheduling that considers your workspace state, time of day, and day of week before showing notifications. We're not changing the frequency—same 6 notifications per month maximum—we're just showing them at better moments.

#### ✨ What's New

- **⏰ Smart Timing Analysis** — Notifications now wait for optimal moments based on tens of thousands of user interaction patterns
- **🎯 Zero Configuration** — The system adapts automatically to your workflow without any settings or preferences
- **🛡️ Same Protection Guarantees** — All existing safeguards remain: 48-hour cooldown, 6 notifications/month max, three-strike pause system
- **📊 Data-Driven Decisions** — Scheduling decisions based on real user engagement data, not guesswork

#### 🎭 How It Works

The system considers multiple signals before showing a notification:

- **Workspace Context** — Respects your current focus (open editors, unsaved files, terminal activity)
- **Time of Day** — Avoids interrupting during high-intensity work periods
- **Day of Week** — Recognizes patterns like Monday momentum vs. mid-week focus time

This is continuous work. We're committed to building a notification system that respects your workflow while keeping you informed about features and updates that matter.

## [3.14.1] - 2026-01-15

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Improvements

**Pro Tree Synchronization:**

- Fixed Pro log tree panel not consistently syncing with live file changes
- Replaced unreliable `createFileSystemWatcher` with `onDidSaveTextDocument` for immediate tree updates on file save

**PLG Notification System:**

- Improved duplicate detection to properly sync local guard keys with backend state
- Fixed milestone flags not updating when backend identifies duplicates, preventing potential notification loops across sessions

## [3.14.0] - 2026-01-11

### 🛡️ Enhanced Notification Reliability & Multi VSCode Instances Support

**Fixed Occasional Duplicate Notifications Across Updates:**

- Resolved occasional issue where some users received duplicate milestone notifications
- **Root Cause**: Global storage state was not consistently persisting across VSCode updates, causing notification flags to not be set properly in certain scenarios
- **Solution**: Implemented robust migration system that ensures notification history persists reliably across all extension and editor lifecycle events

**Less Spammy Experience:**

- Same user on the same machine can now run multiple VSCode instances without notification conflicts
- Milestone notifications (e.g., "100 inserts completed") are now properly synchronized across all VSCode windows
- Each instance respects the global notification state, preventing duplicate celebrations

**Technical Improvements:**

- Enhanced global storage persistence mechanism to survive updates and reinstalls
- Improved notification deduplication logic to handle edge cases in multi-instance environments
- Strengthened state synchronization across VSCode windows on the same machine

### 📊 About Turbo's Respectful Notification System

Turbo Console Log is designed with **user experience first** — notifications only appear when truly meaningful:

- **Milestone Celebrations**: Only when you achieve significant usage thresholds (10, 20, 50, 100+ log insertions)
- **Smart Cooldown**: 2-day minimum gap between milestone notifications to prevent fatigue
- **Monthly Limit**: Maximum 4 milestone/tip notifications per month
- **Release Notes**: ~2 per month for major updates (don't count toward the limit)
- **Total**: ~6-7 notifications/month maximum, all contextual and dismissible

**Why This Fix Matters**: The occasional duplicate bug undermined this careful design by creating unintended notification noise. v3.14.0 ensures the system works exactly as intended — respectful, predictable, and celebrating your actual milestones without repetition.

## [3.13.1] - 2026-01-06

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Double Notification Issue for Fresh Installs:**

- New users now only see the fresh install welcome notification
- Release announcements are now shown exclusively to existing users who are updating

## [3.12.7] - 2025-12-31

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Follow-up to v3.12.6

**Fixed Milestone Flag Persistence:**

- Milestone flags (e.g., "shown 100 inserts notification") now persist even if VS Code reloads before you interact with notifications
- Previously, ignoring a notification then reloading VS Code could cause the same notification to appear again after the cooldown period

**Technical Details:**

- Refactored notification flow to fire-and-forget pattern
- Milestone flags written immediately, immune to extension lifecycle abandonment

### 📊 About the Notification System

Turbo uses a respectful cooldown system to avoid overwhelming you:

- **2-day cooldown** between milestone notifications
- **4 notifications/month max** for milestones and tips
- **~2 release notes/month** (don't count toward the limit)
- **Total: ~6-7 notifications/month maximum**

Thank you for your patience and feedback! 🙏

Wishing you all a fantastic new year 2026 🚀 🎉

## [3.12.6] - 2025-12-31

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

#### Fixed Race Condition Causing Duplicate Notifications

- **Issue**: Users were receiving multiple identical notifications when reaching some milestones
- **Root Cause**: Notification cooldown timestamp was updated asynchronously after notification completion, allowing rapid-fire command executions to bypass cooldown checks
- **Result**: Duplicate notifications are now completely prevented, even when the conditions of an event are met multiple times

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by duplicate notifications. This hotfix ensures a much better notification experience going forward.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Improvements

#### Enhanced JSX Support in .js Files

Fixes [#316](https://github.com/Chakroun-Anas/turbo-console-log/issues/316)

- **Automatic JSX Detection**: The parser now automatically detects and handles JSX syntax in `.js` files without requiring explicit configuration
- **Intelligent Fallback Mechanism**: When parsing fails in `.js` files, the engine automatically retries with JSX support enabled, seamlessly handling React projects that use JSX in `.js` files
- **No Performance Impact**: Regular `.js` files without JSX parse efficiently on the first attempt; the fallback only activates when needed
- **Improved Developer Experience**: React developers can now use Turbo Console Log in `.js` files with JSX syntax without any workarounds or file extension changes

#### Test Coverage Expansion

- **9 New Test Cases**: Added comprehensive test coverage for JSX patterns in `.js` files:
  - React functional components with hooks
  - JSX fragments and spread operators
  - Nested ternary operators in JSX
  - Self-closing tags and spread props
  - Array methods with JSX mapping
  - Arrow functions with implicit JSX returns
  - Complex conditional rendering patterns
  - Mixed files with both JSX and regular JavaScript
- **Error Handling**: Maintains strict error detection for actual syntax errors while supporting valid JSX patterns

This update resolves parsing issues for React projects using `.js` files with JSX syntax, a common pattern in many React codebases, especially those created with older versions of Create React App or custom configurations.

## [3.12.0] - 2025-12-10

## [3.8.1] - 2025-10-16

### 🎯 Vue Single File Component (SFC) Support — Limitation Removed

Turbo Console Log now fully supports **Vue Single File Components (.vue files)** with `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style>` sections. This addresses the temporary limitation introduced by the lightweight Acorn AST engine migration in v3.8.0.

#### ✨ What's New

- **Native `.vue` File Parsing**: Full support for `<script>` and `<script setup>` blocks within Vue SFC structure
- **Dual-Script Context Awareness**: Intelligently handles Vue files with both `<script>` and `<script setup>` sections
- **No New Dependencies**: Built entirely on the existing Acorn AST engine — no additional parsers needed
- **Composition API & Options API**: Works seamlessly with both Vue coding styles
- **TypeScript in Vue**: Full support for `<script lang="ts">` and `<script setup lang="ts">`

#### 🚀 Performance & Architecture

- **Lightweight Implementation**: No external Vue parser dependencies — keeps the extension fast and minimal
- **AST-Powered Precision**: Leverages the same Acorn engine from v3.8.0 for accurate code understanding
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive test coverage across all 31 helper functions (16 checkers + 15 line helpers)

#### 🧪 Quality Assurance

- **40+ New Tests**: Dedicated Vue SFC test cases across all AST layers
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful error messages for files without `<script>` tags or selections outside script blocks
- **Zero Regressions**: All 1,193 tests passing with Vue support fully integrated

#### 📝 What This Means

The **"Temporary Limitation"** mentioned in v3.8.0 is now **completely resolved**. Vue developers can now use Turbo Console Log directly in `.vue` files without any workarounds.

The most requested feature is here! **Hide Logs** lets you temporarily mute specific log entries without deleting them:

- **Hide file logs**: Hide all logs in specific files
- **Hide folder logs**: Hide all logs in a specific folder
- **Toggle visibility**: Reveal all hidden logs with a single action

Managing dozens of log statements just got effortless. Hide everything that's not relevant to your current task, then reveal it all when needed.

### 🧠 Major Engine Upgrade: TypeScript AST → Acorn AST

We've completely rebuilt the parsing engine for better performance and reliability:

#### 📊 Performance Improvements

- **96% smaller package**: 2.6MB → ~108KB (package size)
- **~85% smaller bundle**: 3.7MB → ~560KB (bundled size)
- **~89% faster activation**: 860ms → ~96ms (startup time)

Your extension now loads almost instantly with a dramatically smaller footprint.

#### 🛠️ AST Engine: Parsing Pattern Improvements

The migration to Acorn fixed several edge-case parsing patterns. Log insertion now works correctly in complex real-world code:

- **Variables within return statements**: Correctly identifies when a log should stay inside the return block (e.g., callback parameters, inline expressions) vs. before the return
- **JSX and React patterns**: Full support for modern React code including hooks, fragments, conditional rendering, and implicit arrow function returns
- **Computed property destructuring**: Nested object destructuring patterns with dynamic computed property names (`[id]` syntax)
- **Multi-line object literals**: Complex objects spanning dozens of lines with type annotations, arrow functions, and deep property nesting
- **Binary expressions with optional chaining**: Inequality comparisons using `!==` with optional chaining operators now parse correctly
- **Async destructuring assignments**: Multi-line destructuring from async function calls with type assertions and fallback values
- **Nested default parameters**: Arrow functions with multi-line parameter lists where defaults are themselves function expressions
- **Class method decorators**: Parameters within methods that have multiple decorators (NestJS, Angular patterns)

### 📌 Temporary Limitation

Vue 3 Composition API in separate `.js`/`.ts` files is fully supported. However, Single-File Components (`.vue` with `<script>` blocks) aren't parsed yet.

**Workaround**: Isolate your `<script>` logic in a standalone file while we add first-class SFC support. [Track progress here](https://github.com/Chakroun-Anas/turbo-console-log/issues/292).

### 🔮 What's Next: v3.9.0

The next iteration focuses on broader AST engine strengthening — refining edge-case handling, improving parsing resilience, and expanding framework coverage. Vue Single-File Component support is part of this roadmap, bringing native `.vue` parsing alongside deeper pattern recognition for modern JavaScript constructs.

### 🚀 Enhanced Pro Experience

All Pro features now run on the new Acorn engine — lighter, faster, and more responsive. Hide Logs is the first of several power-user upgrades coming in future releases.

## [3.4.2] - 2025-08-06

### 🎯 Scoped shortcuts, reduced conflicts, and reinforced control

This patch addresses an important usability issue:  
Some Turbo commands were triggering inside the terminal and other non-editor views — which was never intended.

To resolve this:

- 🧠 All Turbo Console Log keyboard shortcuts are now scoped with `"when": "editorTextFocus"`, meaning they will only trigger inside active editors.
- ✅ This completely eliminates unintended behaviors in terminal, sidebar, search, and other UI panels.
- 🔒 Terminal actions like `Ctrl+K` to clear output are now fully respected.

We also want to take a moment to highlight that **Turbo now supports 6 brand-new log insertion shortcuts** — one for each log method, with intuitive and conflict-free bindings:

- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+L` → `console.log`
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+N` → `console.info` (N = Note)
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+R` → `console.warn` (R = Risk)
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+E` → `console.error`
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+B` → `console.debug` (B = Breakpoint)
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T` → `console.table`
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+K` → Custom log

These shortcuts are fast, native, and designed to feel second-nature in your workflow.

We recognize that v3.4.0 introduced a few unintended side effects, and we reacted as quickly as possible to fix them while also addressing the root causes.

We’ll also be increasing integration test coverage around keyboard shortcuts and context detection to avoid this in future releases.

Thanks to everyone who flagged this early and respectfully — you're helping make Turbo even sharper.

## [3.4.1] - 2025-08-06

### 🔧 Fixing shortcut conflicts and refining mental model

After the v3.4.0 release introduced new console log shortcuts, we received helpful community feedback about conflicts with native VSCode keybindings. This patch resolves those issues and improves the logic behind our shortcut assignments to better match intuitive developer mental models:

- 🛠️ Replaced the conflicting `Ctrl+K Ctrl+C` shortcut for **Insert Custom Log** with `Ctrl+K Ctrl+K`, avoiding override of VSCode’s native **Add Line Comment** command  
  ([#284](https://github.com/Chakroun-Anas/turbo-console-log/issues/284))

- 🔁 Changed **Insert Console Info** from `Ctrl+K Ctrl+I` to `Ctrl+K Ctrl+N` → _N = Note_, avoiding conflict with **Show Hover**

- 🔁 Changed **Insert Console Debug** from `Ctrl+K Ctrl+D` to `Ctrl+K Ctrl+B` → _B = Breakpoint_, avoiding conflict with **Move last selection to next match**

- 🔁 Changed **Insert Console Warn** from `Ctrl+K Ctrl+W` to `Ctrl+K Ctrl+R` → _R = Risk_, avoiding conflict with **Close All Editors**

This update ensures all Turbo Console Log shortcuts are now:

- Conflict-free across macOS and Windows
- Easy to remember
- Consistent with VSCode's native behaviors

Thanks again to the community for the quick and constructive feedback!

✅ It **can be dismissed** and won’t reappear until the next release.  
✅ Turbo Console Log is **completely free & open-source**, with no paywalls.  
✅ We follow a **structured, predictable release schedule** for transparency.
