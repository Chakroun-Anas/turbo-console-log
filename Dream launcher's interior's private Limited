## What is Turbo Console Log?

**Turbo Console Log automates the tedious parts of debugging in JavaScript and TypeScript.** With the Pro bundle, PHP support is now available, bringing intelligent logging to multiple languages in VS Code.

It helps you insert, manage, and clean log statements across your code, whether you're using `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, and more in JavaScript, or `var_dump`, `print_r`, `error_log` in PHP, or even a fully custom logging function.

Powered by a full AST engine, Turbo understands your code structure and adds logs precisely where they belong, making debugging faster and less repetitive. No more manually typing variable names or hunting down scattered console statements.

**Turbo Console Log is expanding beyond JavaScript.** For the first time, Pro users can now use the same intelligent logging workflow in PHP projects.

This release brings full AST-powered logging to PHP, with the same precision and context awareness you're used to in JavaScript and TypeScript. Whether you're working on Laravel applications, WordPress plugins, or standalone PHP projects, Turbo now understands your code structure and inserts logs exactly where they belong.

### PHP Support Features

- **Smart Variable Detection** – Automatically captures variable names and context
- **Multiple Logging Methods** – Support for `var_dump`, `print_r`, and `error_log`
- **AST-Powered Placement** – Logs appear in the right place, even in complex code structures
- **Unified Workflow** – Same keyboard shortcuts and commands you already know
- **Full TreeView Integration** – PHP logs appear alongside JavaScript logs in the native panel

### Why PHP?

With millions of PHP developers worldwide and countless legacy and modern PHP projects in active development, bringing intelligent logging to PHP was a natural next step. More languages are on the roadmap.
